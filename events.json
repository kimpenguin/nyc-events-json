Philippe Petit had been dreaming about the towers for six years and had spent eight months in New York planning the masterstroke. With the help of friends and other collaborators, Petit was able to get around the security of the World Trade Center, bringing inside the heavy steel wire as well as all the necessary equipment for the exploit, and stringing the wire across the two towers. Oscar&reg; winner for best documentary in 2009, James Marsh&#39;s film narrates an extraordinary adventure featuring the testimony of the protagonist, the young tightrope walker who surprised the world with his high-wire walk across New York&#39;s twin towers, delivering an unparalleled, unique show that became known as the artistic crime of the century.

Yet the work also suggests the limitations of mere acknowledgment, in some cases proposing or supporting models of indigenous sovereignty and sustainability that defy a singular narrative or type of mark-making. Many of the works on view combine traditional craft with contemporary art practices, while rejecting cultural assimilation and asserting the importance of craft, performance, and storytelling in maintaining ties to land and community and as a form of activism.<\/p>\n\n<p>Much of the art is site-specific and created for this exhibition, including Jeremy Dennis&rsquo; photos and map of culturally significant Native American sites in Brooklyn; Dennis RedMoon Darkeem&rsquo;s interactive gumball machine featuring trade items found on OSH land in the 1600s; Natasha Smoke Santiago&rsquo;s ceramic tile made in the Iroquois pottery tradition documenting local trade history; and Ella Mahoney&rsquo;s outdoor banners that draw from her Aquinnah Wampanoag background to imagine a decolonized future for the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Land Markings <\/em>precedes the upcoming redesign of the Old Stone House&rsquo;s permanent exhibit to include its Lenape history. Today, despite the displacement of its original Lenape residents, New York City still has one of the largest intertribal indigenous communities in the country. <em>Land Markings<\/em> is the first in a series of exhibits and programs at OSH that will provide opportunities for contemporary Indigenous artists to connect a greater awareness of the past to critical conversations about Brooklyn&rsquo;s future, including fair and sustainable uses of our natural and built environment.  <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.
