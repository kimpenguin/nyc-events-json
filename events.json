In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.
